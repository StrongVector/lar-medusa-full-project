## What is Medusa?

[Medusa](https://medusajs.com/) is a set of commerce modules and tools that allow you to build rich, reliable, and performant commerce applications without reinventing core commerce logic. The modules can be customized and used to build advanced ecommerce stores, marketplaces, or any system that needs foundational commerce primitives. All modules are open-source and freely available on NPM.

Learn more about [Medusaâ€™s architecture](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/fundamentals/architecture-overview) and [commerce modules](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/overview) in Medusa's documentation.

## Getting started

> Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/backend/install#prerequisites) to learn about required tools for the Medusa Backend.

1\. Run `create-medusa-app` with the `nextjs-commerce` starter:

```bash
npx create-medusa-app@nextjs-commerce
```

This will create a new main folder with two subfolders for Medusa and Next.js Commerce respectively.

2\. Create a Postgres database named `vercel-commerce` and make sure the Postgres server is running locally.

3\. Inside your newly created `nextjs-commerce` project, change to the `medusa` folder and seed the database:

```bash
cd nextjs-commerce/medusa
yarn seed
```

This will provide you with some demo products and the necessary product categories to fill out the homepage.

## Running Medusa

From the `medusa` subfolder, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

Your Medusa server should now be running on [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/).

## Running Next.js Commerce

1\. You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. Copy the contents of .env.example to a .env file in the root of your Next.js Commerce project, and make sure the NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_API environment variable points to your Medusa backend domain (default: http://localhost:9000).

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets.

2\. From the `nextjs-commerce` subfolder, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
