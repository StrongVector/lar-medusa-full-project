## What is Medusa?

[Medusa](https://medusajs.com/) is a set of commerce modules and tools that allow you to build rich, reliable, and performant commerce applications without reinventing core commerce logic. The modules can be customized and used to build advanced ecommerce stores, marketplaces, or any system that needs foundational commerce primitives. All modules are open-source and freely available on NPM.

Learn more about [Medusaâ€™s architecture](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/fundamentals/architecture-overview) and [commerce modules](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/overview) in Medusa's documentation.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended to use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets.

1\. Install Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2\. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (which creates a `.vercel` directory):

```bash
vercel link
```

3\. Download your environment variables:

```bash
vercel env pull
```

4\. Install dependencies and run your app:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## How to configure your Medusa backend for Next.js Commerce

Next.js Commerce x Medusa requires a running [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) backend.

### Prerequisites

Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/backend/install#prerequisites) to learn about required tools for the Medusa Backend.

### How to Install the Medusa Backend

1\. Install the Medusa CLI tool:

```bash
npm install @medusajs/medusa-cli -g
```

2\. Run the following command to create a Medusa backend:

```bash
medusa new my-medusa-store https://github.com/medusajs/medusa-starter-default/tree/nextjs-commerce --seed
```

3\. Start the Medusa backend:

```bash
cd my-medusa-store
medusa develop
```

4\. Copy the contents of .env.example to a .env file in the root of your Next.js Commerce project, and make sure the NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_API environment variable points to your Medusa backend domain (default: http://localhost:9000).

### (Optional) Install Medusa Admin plugin and add product categories

Medusa comes with a few demo products, but they won't show up in the template by default. To showcase products in the store, you need to install the Medusa Admin and add a few product categories. To do that:

1. Install the [Medusa Admin plugin](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart)
2. Enable the [Product Categories feature flag](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/products/categories)
3. Log in to the admin dashboard and create the following product categories:

- hidden-homepage-carousel
- hidden-homepage-featured-items

4. Assign a few products to both categories and they should now show up on the homepage!
